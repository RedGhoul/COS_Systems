# Scope Identification
For our capstone project, the system we are designing is called the Cognitive Oncology System (COS). The COS should be able to identify prostate tumors using image segmentation on Medical Resonance Imaging scans. Medical imaging is a non-invasive method used to visualize the body parts, tissues and organs of the human body.
##Branching off from data analysis, machine learning is a relatively new form of artificial intelligence. It is an application that is vastly being advertised and used by many industries. However, there is a lack of machine learning applications in the medical industry. Since there is an unfulfilled market need for machine learning, we have decided to base our product towards an application that will benefit the medical industry.
