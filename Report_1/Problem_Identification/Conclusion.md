This type of non-invasive imaging is important because doctors do not have to surgically open up the body to see what is inside it. This eliminates surgical incisions and recovery time for the patient which is very beneficial for them. The oncologist can simply use one or multiple medical imaging techniques and identify the patientsâ€™ health condition based upon the results of the medical images. Image segmentation can be utilized by medical field professionals in final diagnosis of various cancers. Image segmentation in medical imaging can also be used to monitor/compare certain tumors, and help identify early onset tumors. Finally, our project sets out to optimize the process for identifying prostate cancer seen on MRI scans by using image segmentation.
