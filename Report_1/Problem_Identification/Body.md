##We will be designing an expert system called the Cognitive Oncology Systems (COS). COS tackles two of the major problems associated with the diagnosis of prostate cancer faced by Oncologists. Examining prostate cancer requires an experienced Oncologist that is able to analyze the different cross sections of a scan to clearly identify any tumor present. Our COS will have the ability to perform this duty without the need of an experienced doctor. In addition, another problem that oncologists seem to face is the ability to organize all the scans of his or her patients. Our COS will provide a database that will organize all this information to combat this issue. 

##We choose to apply machine learning to medical imaging since itâ€™s a non-invasive method used to visualize the body parts, tissues and organs of the human body. It is used to assist in the diagnoses, treatment and monitoring of many different health conditions. There are different types of methods of medical imaging which consist of ultrasounds, MRI, CT scan, CAT scan, X-rays and many more. However, COS will be able to identify prostate cancer in MRI scans using deep learning image based segmentation.
