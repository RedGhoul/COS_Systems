# Stakeholder Analysis and Identification (still in progress)
The design of the Cognitive Oncology System (COS) will be based on the interests, needs and requirements of the stakeholders. The web-based application will allow the authorized user to view patient diagnosesâ€™, statistics, and general medical history. Using image segmentation, it will also allow the user to monitor patient tumor growth and notify the user of any changes. In this section, we will clearly identify the stakeholders, the requirements of the stakeholders, and how we will model our project according to general requirements and laws.

As the stakeholders hold a direct influence on the final product, it is necessary to include a breakdown analysis of stakeholder requirements and methods to control stakeholder engagement. Stakeholders will be categorized for planning and management purposes. The general steps include identifying the stakeholder, planning and executing stakeholder management, then finally managing and controlling the level of stakeholder engagement. A variety of tools will be used to analyze this relationship, and the final results will be integrated to maximize the products success. The stakeholders will also be categorized based on interests. Common interests include economics, social, work/time efficiency and safety and security. 

The stakeholders of our final product can be divided into three categories: 
- Primary stakeholders
- Secondary stakeholders
- Key stakeholders

It should also be noted that each stakeholder holds a relation to one another, these interactions between each type directly affects the outcome of our product. The influence of a certain group is based on level of resources, power and type of resources readily available. The three categories are explained in more detail below.

The primary stakeholders are comprised of individuals who have a direct impact on our product, or who are directly involved with the product. In this case, our primary stakeholders are the patients whose medical images will be analyzed. The patients are the individuals who will be directly affected by the results of our product, as our product will help identify the appropriate tumors and hold their medical record. 

In addition, primary stakeholders include developers. Prior to daily use in hospitals and oncology clinics, our product will run through rigorous testing to see if their needs are met and to ensure consistency in the products results. The developers can include those who are analysts, program testers, quality assurance representatives, trainers, and project managers. This group will have an influence in final purchases, and future purchases. By adhering to the requirements of this group, we will have greater chances of future success and expansion.

Secondary stakeholders may not be directly affected, or may not directly impact the chances of products success. Secondary stakeholders will hold an indirect relationship, but still hold influence in this matter. For our product, the secondary shareholders would be the users. This includes oncologists, physicians, and research analysts. There is a focus on the secondary stakeholders because they are the individuals that will be assisting in the diagnosis of the benign, premalignant or malignant tumor(s). They will be utilizing our product through day-to-day use, and will be providing the appropriate feedback of the application. This group can influence in the purchasing decision, but do not make final purchasing decisions.

Our key stakeholders includes the individuals who have the greatest influence in the success of the application. This will mainly include legislators; government agencies, trade unions, legal representatives, safety executives, and quality assurance auditors. This group can affect development and/or operation of the system. As our product includes sensitive data of the patients, our top priority is to adhere to data-protection legislations, guidelines, and the Canada Health Act. 

The key stakeholders also include those in management, and those who make final decisions when purchasing hospital softwares and equipment. This group is comprised of user managers, and hospital committees/boards. These committees manage evaluation, selection, and purchase of medical devices, which is why they are included as our key stakeholders.

The power/interest grid is a common tool used in stakeholder analysis, where it clearly organizes current stakeholders by their influence and interest in the product. As it is not possible to satisfy every individual, it is necessary to prioritize stakeholders in this manner for marketing purposes. Table X displays this relationship (in word doc, will attach)

We can determine the most effective level of engagement based on level of interest and power each group has following the products release. Groups listed under high interest-high influence requires close management following the products release. For overall customer satisfaction, it would be most effective to provide information and updates to those under the high interest category, and monitor those in the low-interest category.
