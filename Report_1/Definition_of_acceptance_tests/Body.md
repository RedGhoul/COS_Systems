###There will be 2 main types of testing that will be performed on our system, one of which is the black box test and the other being the white box test. The black box tests can also be classified as behavioral testing, which is a software testing method. In this type of testing the internal design is unknown to the tester hence the name black box. The tester is mainly concerned with the input and output values. During a black box test, the testing is performed by changing the input values and comparing the systems output values to the expected values.
