Flexibility:
Few projects go exactly as planed and need room to change. For this reason, features to the product are defined as user stories. These stories incapsulate a customer need, an example would be “As a Nurse I can add a new Doctor to a patient’s profile” would a customer story. This user story would then get broken down into several different tasks, that would need to be completed to finish the story. By having explicit tasks, we are given better flexibility over what we finish and when we finish them.
