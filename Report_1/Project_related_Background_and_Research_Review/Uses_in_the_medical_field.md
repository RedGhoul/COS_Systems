## How is image segmentation and deep-learning used in the medical field? 

Accurate segmentation of medical images is a key step in contouring during radiotherapy planning. Computed topography (CT) and Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging are the most widely used radiographic techniques in diagnosis, clinical studies and treatment planning. This review provides details of automated segmentation methods, specifically discussed in the context of CT and MR images. The motive is to discuss the problems encountered in segmentation of CT and MR images, and the relative merits and limitations of methods currently available for segmentation of medical images.

Reliable algorithms are required for the delineation of anatomical structures and other regions of interest (ROI). The goals of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) are:

To automate the process so that large number of cases can be handled with the same accuracy i.e. the results are not affected as a result of fatigue, data overload or missing manual steps.
To achieve fast and accurate results. Very high-speed computers are, now, available at modest costs, speeding up computer-based processing in the medical field.
To support faster communication, wherein patient care can be extended to remote areas using information technology.
The techniques available for segmentation of medical images are specific to application, imaging modality and type of body part to be studied. For example, requirements of brain segmentation are different from those of thorax. The artifacts, which affect the brain image, are different - partial volume effect is more prominent in brain while in the thorax region it is motion artifact which is more prominent.
