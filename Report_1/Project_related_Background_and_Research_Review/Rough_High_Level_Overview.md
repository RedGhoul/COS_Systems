## The activity is Application of Deep Learning to Image Segmentation

Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in various computer vision applications. Image semantic segmentation is one of the key problems in the field of computer vision, and it is to detect and localize different objects or specific regions of an image. Looking at the big picture, semantic segmentation is one of the high-level tasks that paves the way toward complete scene understanding. However, it is still a very challenge task for real-time accurate semantic segmentation. Semantic segmentation has the potential to revolutionize many fields such as self-driving cars and mobile robots.

The main objectives of the project are to: 

Discuss the different layers of a neural network 

Develop a web-based application that will allow hospital oncologists to acces their specific databases for their patient data i.e. CT scans, and have a comparison of a segmented image versus the original image, allowing for a more efficient way of diagnosing their patients correctly.
