## What is Image Segmentation? 

The term image segmentation refers to the partition of an image into a set of regions that cover it. The goal in many tasks is for the regions to represent meaningful areas of the image, such as the crops, urban areas, and forests of a satellite image. In other analysis tasks, the regions might be sets of border pixels grouped into such structures as line segments and circular arc segments in images of 3D industrial objects. Regions may also be dened as groups of pixels having both a border and a particular shape such as a circle or ellipse or polygon. When the interesting regions do not cover the whole image, we can still talk about segmentation, into foreground regions of interest and background regions to be ignored.

Shown above is an example of a T1 weighted MR image of the brain of a patient with a meningioma after injection of a MRI contrast agent (top left), and the same image with the result of an interactive segmentation overlaid in green (3D model of the segmentation on the top right, axial and coronal views at the bottom).
