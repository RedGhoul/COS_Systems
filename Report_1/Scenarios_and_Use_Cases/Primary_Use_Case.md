We will have 2 primary scenarios and use cases for our COS. The first use case is the main purpose of our project which is being able to identify prostate cancer using image segmentation on MRI scans. This is to aid Oncologists in the process of identification and diagnosis of prostate cancer. Our second use case is to provide Health Care Practitioners with a web interface that allows them to manage and monitor patient data. This web application will allow Health Care Practitioners to create, read, upload and destroy (CRUD) patient scans. The purpose of this is to have a user friendly storage system where all patient information can be easily accessed, including the image segmented scans of the patient.s
