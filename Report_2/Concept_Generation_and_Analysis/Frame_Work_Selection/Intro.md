# Deep Learning Frameworks
# Introduction to Framworks

There are a number of them out there, however the major ones are as follows. Tensor Flow, PyThorch, and Caffe 2.
Our decision was based on three major factors.

### Talk about computational Graphs

### Community
We care about this since we want good documentation

### Language
We care about this because we want an easy to use API 

### Performance 
We care about this since we want to train fast, not long
