We choose to use server side rendering over, client side rendering since it would greatly speed up our development time.
The core COS product does not require complicated UI interactions therefor the use of a client side framework would
unessarly increase complicity.
For any sort of key user functionality we choose to use a minimal set of front end technolgies, that provided a large amount of
functionality out of the box. Therefor we use CDNs that hold our CSS and javascript rather then sending it over the server.
