In the end we choose to go with Tensor Flow since it had a better community and CUDA support. We did not choose to go with its nearest competitor, since it was not as well documented, and its community had just started to grow. Where as Tensor Flow has been thoroughly documented and has had large deployments outside of Google (such as at places like Linkedin, Intel, IBM, and UBER). Another major selling point for Tensor Flow is the fact that, it is free, continually getting newer releases, and is fast becoming an industry standard tool.
A summary of our finding can be seen below.
