# Deep Learning Frameworks
# Introduction to Framworks

Due to the exponential expansion of ML research and computing power seen over the last decade. There has also been an explosion of new types of software infrastructure to harness it. This software has come from both academic and commercial sources. The need for this infrastructure arises from the fact that there needs to be a bridge between theory and application. When we looked at what were the most popular frameworks, we found it was a mix of strictly academic and commercial driven software. The four main frameworks were Caffe, Theano, Caffe2 + PyTorch, and Tensor Flow.

### Community
We care about this since we want good documentation

### Language
We care about this because we want an easy to use API 

### Performance 
We care about this since we want to train fast, not long
