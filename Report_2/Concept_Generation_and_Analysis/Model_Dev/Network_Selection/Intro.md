COS will be using a CNN based on the U-NET architecture. The development of the model had us make three main choices: Hardware selection, ML framework selection, and CNN architecture selection. We decided not use cloud based virtual machines since in the long term it would be very expensive. The ML framework we choose was Google’s Tensor flow (TF) since it has become the standard in both academic use and production use. TF is what powers all the ML features in all of Google’s products. We choose a CNN over other types of ML models since it has been shown to do the best for visual data learning.

The ML model we will be using is the NN type. It has been proven to be an effective method to learn visual information. However it comes in a number of different types, CNN, GAN, and RNN. We choose CNN since it was proven to have the best results for image identification. We also saw CNNs in a number of different medical research papers. That detailed their successful application in identifying different aspects of medical images.
