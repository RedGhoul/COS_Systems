The ML model we will be using is the NN type. It has been proven to be an effective method to learn visual information. However it comes in a number of different types, CNN, GAN, and RNN. We choose CNN since it was proven to have the best results for image identification. We also saw CNNs in a number of different medical research papers. That detailed their successful application in identifying different aspects of medical images.
