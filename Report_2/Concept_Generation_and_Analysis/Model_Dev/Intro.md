## Model Development - Intro

When looking into developing our model we identified the three key chooses, framework selection, hardware selection, and network selection. We identified framework selection as a key choose since, it would act as the key building blocks in constructing the models, and effect how fast we could train them. Where as with hardware selection was important since it would be the primary limiting factor in how fast we could train the model. And finally Network selection would be the most important, since it would greatly effect how effective our model would be after we trained it.
